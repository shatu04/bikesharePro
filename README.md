## 🚲 US Bikeshare Data Analysis Tool – Submission Note

### 🔍 Overview

This Python script performs an interactive analysis of bikeshare data for three major US cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. Users can filter the dataset by city, month, and day of the week to explore usage patterns and trends.

---

### ✅ Features Implemented

* **Interactive filtering** of city, month, and day (with case-insensitive input and error handling)
* **Descriptive statistics**:

  * Most common times of travel
  * Popular stations and trip combinations
  * Trip duration stats
  * User type, gender, and birth year analysis
* **Modular code** using well-documented functions with docstrings
* **Data display functionality**:

  * Users can view raw data in 5-row increments
  * Repeats until user says 'no' or data ends
* **Defensive programming**:

  * Handles unexpected or invalid inputs gracefully

---

### 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

* `pandas` for data analysis
* `time` for performance tracking
* Clean function design with docstrings following PEP 257

---

### 🧪 How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required package:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. Place the city CSV files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`) in the same directory.
4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python bikeshare.py
   ```
